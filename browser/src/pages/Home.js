        Visualizing the process of requesting Freedom of Information Law
        Requests from New York State Police Departments

      <p>
        In June of 2020, New York’s Governor, Andrew Cuomo signed a bill
        repealing section 50-a of the state’s Civil Rights law that had been
        used to prevent police officer misconduct allegations and
        investiagtions from being subject to freedom of information law
        requests. Muckrock began sending FOIL requests to every police
        department in New York state shortly after, and their site contains
        the documents obtained and provides the data surrounding these
        requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team at Astoria Digital is using the data from these request to
        create visualizations to show their process in real time.
